Using the Web API v3
{% endanchor %}

###[Authentication]({{root_url}}/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/How_To_Use_The_Web_API_v3/authentication.html)

Every API request you make to the Web API v3 must be authenticated by including an Authorization Header with your API Key.

{% codeblock lang:bash %} curl -X "GET" "https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/templates" -H "Authorization: Bearer Your.API.Key-HERE" -H "Content-Type: application/json" {% endcodeblock %}

To access the API with the elevated permissions of the full user account, for example to change permission scope of an API Key, you can access the API with basic HTTP authentication. More information about basic auth can be found [here](https://sendgrid.com/blog/magic-behind-basic-http-authentication/).

{% codeblock lang:bash %} curl -X "GET" "https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/api_keys" -H "Authorization: Basic base64encoded.user:password-HERE" -H "Content-Type: application/json" {% endcodeblock %}

###[Requests]({{root_url}}/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/How_To_Use_The_Web_API_v3/requests.html)

All requests to the Web API v3 must be made via HTTPS. The Web API v3 is completely RESTful and accepts GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests, depending on the resource.

{% codeblock lang:http %}
POST https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/templates/ HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "new template name"
}
{% endcodeblock %}

###[Responses]({{root_url}}/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/How_To_Use_The_Web_API_v3/responses.html)

The Web API v3 provides a selection of response codes, content-type headers, and pagination options to help you interpret the responses to your API requests.

**Your Request**
{% codeblock lang:http %}
GET https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/resource HTTP/1.1
{% endcodeblock %}

**Our Response**
{% codeblock lang:http %}
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "foo": "bar",
}
{% endcodeblock %}


###[Rate Limits]({{root_url}}/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/How_To_Use_The_Web_API_v3/rate_limits.html)


Depending on the endpoint you are trying to reach, it will have a
specific number of allowed requests per refresh period. Once this
threshold has been reached, we will return a status code `429` response.

###[Errors]({{root_url}}/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/How_To_Use_The_Web_API_v3/errors.html)

Sometimes your API call will generate an error. Every response to an API call that generates an error will include an error code, the reason for the error, and an error message to help you debug your request.
